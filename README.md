Analysis:
The smaller the school, the higher their results for ever measure (average maths score, average reading score, % passing maths, % passing reading and % passing overall)
See the chart for Scores by School Size

The higher the budget, and the more the school spends per student, does not mean they will be the most successful school in terms of their academic results. 
The 2nd Top Performing School (Cabrera High School) and 4th Top Performing School (Wright High School), spent less than $582 and $583 per student, respectively.
