Module 4 Homework Pandas Challenge

Analysis:

Overview:
The analysis looks at 7 government and 8 independent schools. In total these 15 school teach 39,170	students, on a total budget of $24,649,428.00, and an overall pass rate of 72.81%. Analysis shows that:
1. The smaller the school, the higher the average pass marks, and the higher the percentage of students who pass their maths and reading studies, 
2. Students at independent schools have higher average pass marks, and a higher percentage of students who pass their maths and reading studies, than government schools, 
3. The size of the school budget and the spending per student, do not correlate highly with whether the students are more or less successful in passing their studies.

Observation 1: 
The small schools with less than 1000 students, had the highest percentages of students passing their maths and reading based on evey measure (average maths score, average reading score, % passing maths, % passing reading and % passing overall)
The next most successful where the medium sized schools with 1000 to 2000 students, who achieved slightly better results than the largest schools who have between 2000 and 5000 students. 
See the chart for Scores by School Size

Observation 2:
The higher the budget, and the more the school spends per student, does not mean they will be a more successful school in terms of their maths and reading results. 
The 2nd Top Performing School (Cabrera High School) and 4th Top Performing School (Wright High School), spent less than $582 and $583 per student, respectively.
Conversely, 4 of the bottom 5 performing schools spent in excess of $640 per student.
